### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an accountant, after 10 years working in the field I realized that this is not where I want to be. I decided to start all over again to become a developer, a career that passions me, makes me move forward and leaves me always wanting more. I am hungry for knowledge,  willing to grow and be part of a field that is constantly evolving.
